### Dear friend! If you did something for tracking.exposed: great! Sadly, the effort isnâ€™t concluded until your contribution is adequately reported in the â€˜analysis-and-publicationâ€™ list! It is our piece of HTML documenting all the projectâ€™s developments, and yours should be there too. It doesnâ€™t matter if a handful of persons attended your event or if everyone was distracted. We should keep track of each advocacy effort. Even an apparently meaningless event, after six months, could acquire a different meaning. So please, for future references, and to better focus our energies in the future, record your contribution!

**You've to edit** (or propose a pull request) to [this file on github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracking-exposed/facebook.tracking.exposed/master/content/analysis-and-publications.md), which [becomes like a list of events](https://facebook.tracking.exposed/analysis-and-publications/) in the end.

Each entry has this format:

```
resource
  kind="article"
  title="Facebook's Algorithm Shapes Our Lives. This Hacker Wants to Find Out How."
  when="July"  
  nature="external"
  author="Alex Fanta"
  authorLink="https://netzpolitik.org/author/alexander-fanta/"
  description="Netzpolitik interview to Claudio Agosti on the Tracking Exposed project and plan"
  href="https://netzpolitik.org/2019/facebooks-algorithm-shapes-our-lives-this-hacker-wants-to-find-out-how/#spendenleiste"
```

You don't need to insert every line. For example, `author` and `authorLink` shouldn't appear often, they are meant for persons OUTSIDE of the project. Additionally, the speaker/project member, should go in the description.

### How many entry you should provide?

* Each advocacy moment needs a dedicated entry. For example, in the DMI Winter School, the final report and the final presentation should be counted as separated entries.
* In a conference, event, and talk they are all the same. In general, there should be only one content link per entry.

### Should I append my thing even if wasn't Facebook related?

Yes, we'll have a collection of articles/publications/links for each project, and the tracking.exposed will have all of them. Please don't forget to add your contributions!
