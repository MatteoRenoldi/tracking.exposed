* How to keep track of our progresses: we have a mailing list (low traffic), a [Mattermost channel](https://chat.securitywithoutborders.org/community/channels/trackingexposed), a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/trackingexposed) account, [fediverse / nebbia.fail](https://nebbia.fail/@TRackingEXposed), and a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/personalizationalgorithm/) page. All of these sources should be harmonious and complementary. Unfortunately,at the moment, they are badly used. We will focus on this soon :)
* Rai 3, a TV channel of the Italian public broadcast network, featured our research! We shared our first [Amazon](https://amazon.tracking.exposed) investigation. If you speak Italian, please skip the first 2:18 and watch the episode ["Il mondo (segreto) di Amazon"](https://www.raiplay.it/video/2019/11/petrolio-il-mondo-segreto-di-amazon-aa6d4781-bc5c-4c51-9463-c22f399797d1.html).
* This is the complete [report in Italian](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/presentation/blob/master/amazon.tracking.exposed%20report%20Italiano%20-%201.0%20.pdf).
* We are not going to release a 2019 summary doc; *Happy new year!*
